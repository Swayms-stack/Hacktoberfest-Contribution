Title: Soundwave

Tech stacks: HTML, CSS

I tried to replicate spotify website using my creative way of design. I made home page looks more appealing and I added discovery and join page to make it look like a real music website. I am thinking to add javascript to it and make it a real one.

**Home page**
<img src = "home.png">

**Discovery page**
<img src = "discovery.png">

**Join page**
<img src = "join.png">
